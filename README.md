Database:
I have  used Mysql Query to create the database and all the tables.

For the Backend coding part :

The Connection.php file containes connection logic with the database. 
The Catagories.php conatines the logic to perform the crude operation for catagories .
The Post.php file containes the logic to perform the CRUDE operation for Blogs.
The Users.php file containes the logic to perform  register and login and also logout system .

I Have followed the OOP process to build this project. 
And I have try to cover the necessary PHP oop concepts to showcase the project.
